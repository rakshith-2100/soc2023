In This four weeks i ave learnt:
 1) Deep Learning Python Libraries like tensorflow
 2) Some Insights on how traditinal chess algorithm works 
 3) Read some research papers on some chess alogorithms such as alphazero, deepchess, giraffe,maiachess etc..
 4) Had a good understanding on alphazero chess model 
I would be implementing alpha zero chess model and would ideate a good algorithm using the knowledge that i have in the further weeks.
